add score keeping (and speed up the game as the score increases)

refactor

only allow the player to turn 90 degrees in one step

give some sort of indication when game is lost (and provide restart option)

add walls

maybe write a retrospective on this (it has had some suprisingly difficult problems for such a simple game)
  what makes a snake game fun?
    right amount of space to maneuver in
    removing dumb deaths (like pressing right when going left)
  how do you receive input that stays in sync with the game speed while still feeling responsive
